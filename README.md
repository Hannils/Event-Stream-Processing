  ### Day 0
  Setup: Getting to know the office, installing visual studio. Getting familiar with environment
  Getting to know c#
  Started implementing some basic functions and middlewares with a webserver. Middlewares include: Logging and basic analytics such as saving the amount of times the endpoint was requested.
  Played around with tests, TestHost and TestServer following this: https://www.roundthecode.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-web-api/asp-net-core-testserver-xunit-test-web-api-endpoints. Had a problem but eventually did Assembly.Load(“TestAPI”) and then it worked.
  
  ### Day 1
  
  Had a quick meeting with external supervisor talking about the next step. Our plan is to create a Miro board so that everyone involved will have the same expectations of what the result will look like.
  Created a Miro board with a simple representation of what the ESP will consist of. [Miro Board](./documenting-resources/ESP-Unit1.png)
